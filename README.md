# What does project do

This system is let you take survey using ethereum platform and give ERC20 as reward to respondent.
Below are short summaries of the features.

- Respondent can see list of surveys
- Respondent can create a survey (user creating survey becomes owner of survey)
- Respondent can answer survey if it has some token reward left and it is before deadline
- Owner can see details of survey
- Owner can charge survey with ERC20 (At this time, it is specific token called SurveyToken)
- Owner can see answers of survey
- Respondent can retrieve reward ERC20 token after survey deadline
- Owner can retrieve left over ERC20 token after survey deadline

Current limitations which can be improved with further development are

- Performance up (Maybe uses web server to cache data on blockchain)
- Let owner to decide how much token to give to respondent (currently all respondent get 1 token per answer)
- Fancy result analysis page
- As survey respondent, I do not want to pay gas. So I would like to implement something like meta-transaction in the future.

# User story

- As a survey owner, I want to give ERC20 token to survey taker so that many people takes survey as quickly as possible.
- As a survey respondent, I want to get some incentives so that I am encouraged to take survey and finish quiickly.

# System architecture

System consists of 3 contracts, Survey factory, Survey and ERC20 token.

Survey factory is the contract which creates survey contracts and tracks addresses of deployed surveys.
Survey is the contract which has all survey questions and asnwer. It can also holds ERC20 token as a reward. ERC20 should be charged by survey owner.
Reward can be any ERC20 token, but I have created Survey Token for this project for easily test operation of the system.

Below pictures explains how system works for owner and respondent.

# Development environment setup

## Setup your environment.

```
// move to repository root folder
$ cd ether-survey

// install
$ npm install -g truffle
$ npm install -g ganache-cli
$ npm install
```

Make sure you have metamask installed for your borwser.

The operation is confirmed with below tools / versions.

```
Truffle: v4.1.13
Ganache CLI v6.1.8
node: v10.7.0
npm: 6.2.0
```

## Bootup your local server

### 0. Install metamask (if not yet)

Please install [metamask](https://metamask.io/) or install [brave browser](https://brave.com/) and enable metamask.

### 1. Install npm

Please install npm and dependency for this project

```
$ npm install
```

### 2. ganache-cli

```
$ npm install -g ganache-cli
```

### 3. truffle

```
$ npm install -g truffle
```

### 4. Start local private ethereum with below command

Move to root directory of this repo and run below command.

```
$ sh shell/start_ganache.sh
```

This will create ethereum network running at `localhost:8545`
Take note of Mnemonic to be logged in with Metamask later.

### 5. Compile and dploy contracts

```
$ truffle migrate
```

### 6. Start surver

```
$ npm run start
```

Finally access to `http://localhost:3000`.
Make sure you are logged in to metamask for local blockchain network.

# How to test
